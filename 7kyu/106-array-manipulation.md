### Problem:
<p> Given an array of positive integers, replace every element with the least greater element to its right.
 If there is no greater element to its right, replace it with -1. For instance, given the array </p>
<p> <code>[8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28]</code>,</p>
<p> the desired output is </p>
<p> <code>[18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1]</code>.</p>
<p>Your task is to create a function &quot;arrayManip()&quot; that takes in an array as its argument, manipulates the array as described above, then return the resulting array.</p>
<p>Note: Return a new array, rather than modifying the passed array.</p>
