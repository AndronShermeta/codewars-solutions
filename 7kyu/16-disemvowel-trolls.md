### Problem:
<p>Trolls are attacking your comment section!</p>
<p>A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls&apos; comments, neutralizing the threat.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.</p>
<p>For example, the string &quot;This website is for losers LOL!&quot; would become &quot;Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: for this kata <code>y</code> isn&apos;t considered a vowel.</p>
