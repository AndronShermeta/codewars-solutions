### Problem:
<h1 id="dont-give-me-five">Don&apos;t give me five!</h1>
<p>In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>1,9 -&gt; 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -&gt; Result 8
4,17 -&gt; 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -&gt; Result 12</code></pre><p>The result may contain fives. ;-)<br>
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!</p>
<p>I&apos;m very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.</p>
<p>Have fun coding it and please don&apos;t forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) </p>
<p>I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!</p>
