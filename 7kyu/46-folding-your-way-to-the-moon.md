### Problem:
<p>Have you heard about the myth that <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/31/paper-folding-to-the-moon/" target="_blank">if you fold a paper enough times, you can reach the moon with it</a>? Sure you do, but exactly how many? Maybe it&apos;s time to write a program to figure it out.</p>
<p>You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of <code>0.0001m</code>. Given <code>distance</code> in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.<br>(If you&apos;re not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)</p>
<p>Note: Of course you can&apos;t do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P</p>
<p>Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it&apos;s clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning <code>null</code> (or whatever equivalent in your language. In Shell please return <code>None</code>).</p>
