### Problem:
<p>Due to another of his misbehaved, 
the primary school&apos;s teacher of the young Gau&#xDF;,  Herr J.G. B&#xFC;ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates,
assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s, an example:</p>
<pre><code>f(n=100) // returns 5050 </code></pre><p>It&apos;s your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).</p>
