### Problem:
<p>Given two different positions on a chess board, find the least number of moves it would take a knight to get from one to the other.
The positions will be passed as two arguments in algebraic notation.
For example, <code>knight(&quot;a3&quot;, &quot;b5&quot;)</code> should return 1.</p>
<p>The knight is not allowed to move off the board.
The board is 8x8.</p>
