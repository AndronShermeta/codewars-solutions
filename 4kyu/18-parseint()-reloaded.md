### Problem:
<p>In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;one&quot; =&gt; 1</li>
<li>&quot;twenty&quot; =&gt; 20</li>
<li>&quot;two hundred forty-six&quot; =&gt; 246</li>
<li>&quot;seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen&quot; =&gt; 783919</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum number is &quot;zero&quot; (inclusively)</li>
<li>The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)</li>
<li>The &quot;and&quot; in e.g. &quot;one hundred and twenty-four&quot; is optional, in some cases it&apos;s present and in others it&apos;s not</li>
<li>All tested numbers are valid, you don&apos;t need to validate them</li>
</ul>
