### Problem:
<p>An integer partition of n is a weakly decreasing list of positive integers which sum to n.</p>
<p>For example, there are 7 integer partitions of 5:</p>
<p>[5], [4,1], [3,2], [3,1,1], [2,2,1], [2,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1].</p>
<p>Write a function named partitions which returns the number of integer partitions of n.  The function should be able to find the number of integer partitions of n for n as least as large as 100.  </p>
