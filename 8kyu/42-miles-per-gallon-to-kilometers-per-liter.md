### Problem:
<p>Sometimes, I want to quickly be able to convert miles per imperial gallon into kilometers per liter.</p>
<p>Create an application that will display the number of kilometers per liter (output) based on the number of miles per imperial gallon (input).</p>
<p>Make sure to round off the result to two decimal points. If the answer ends with a 0, it should be rounded off without the 0. So instead of 5.50, we should get 5.5.</p>
<p>Some useful associations relevant to this kata:
1 Imperial Gallon = 4.54609188 litres
1 Mile = 1.609344 kilometres</p>
