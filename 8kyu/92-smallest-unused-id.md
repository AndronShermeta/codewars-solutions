### Problem:
<p>Hey awesome programmer!</p>
<p>You&apos;ve got much data to manage and of course you use zero-based and non-negative ID&apos;s to make each data item unique!</p>
<p>Therefore you need a method, which returns the <b>smallest unused ID</b> for your next new data item...</p>
<p>Note: The given array of used IDs may be unsorted. For test reasons there may be duplicate IDs, but you don&apos;t have to find or remove them!</p>
<p>Go on and code some pure awesomeness!</p>
