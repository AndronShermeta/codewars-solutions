### Problem:
<p>Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).<br>
(The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)<br><br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code>{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } =&gt; 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } =&gt; 6</code></pre><br>

<p>If array is empty, null or None, or if only 1 Element exists, return 0.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>In C++ instead null an empty vector is used. In C there is no null. ;-)
<br><br></p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-comment">-- There&apos;s no null in Haskell, therefore Maybe [Int] is used. Nothing represents null.</span></code></pre>
<p>Have fun coding it and please don&apos;t forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) </p>
<p>I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.</p>
