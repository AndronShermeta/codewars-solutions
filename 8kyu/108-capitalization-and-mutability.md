### Problem:
<p>Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn&apos;t work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string &quot;word&quot; upper case).</p>
<p>Don&apos;t worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.</p>
