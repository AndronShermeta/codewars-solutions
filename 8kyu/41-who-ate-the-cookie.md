### Problem:
<p>For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then &quot;Zach&quot; ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then &quot;Monica&quot; ate the cookie. If the input is anything else &quot;the dog&quot; ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is:
&quot;Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!&quot;</p>
<p>Ex: Input = &quot;hi&quot; --&gt; Output = &quot;Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!
(The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.</p>
<p>Please leave feedback for this kata.
Cheers!</p>
