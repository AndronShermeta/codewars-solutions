### Problem:
<p>You&apos;re on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. The notes come together like you wouln&apos;t believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes. As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that, it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes. You ask, &quot;How much do people normally tip for something like this?&quot; The artist looks up. &quot;Its always gonna be about tree fiddy.&quot;</p>
<p>It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era. The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!</p>
<p>There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster: A.) It is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era B.) It will ask you for tree fiddy</p>
<p>Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase &quot;tree fiddy&quot;. Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster.
Note: It can also be written as 3.50 or three fifty.</p>
