### Problem:
<p>&quot;Point reflection&quot; or &quot;point symmetry&quot; is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.</p>
<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q.
Each argument is a two-element array of integers representing the point&apos;s X and Y coordinates.  Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1.  You do not have to validate the input.</p>
