### Problem:
<p>Nathan loves cycling. </p>
<p>Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.</p>
<p>You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>time = 3 ----&gt; litres = 1</p>
<p>time = 6.7---&gt; litres = 3</p>
<p>time = 11.8--&gt; litres = 5</p>
