### Problem:
<p>Make a function that returns the value multiplied by 50 and increased by 6. If the value entered is a string it should return &quot;Error&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: in <code>C#</code>, you&apos;ll always get the input as a string, so the above applies if the string isn&apos;t representing a double value.</p>
