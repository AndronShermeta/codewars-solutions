### Problem:
<p>Let&apos;s imagine we have a popular online RPG. A player begins with a score of 0 in class E5. A1 is the highest level a player can achieve.</p>
<p>Now let&apos;s say the players wants to rank up to class E4. To do so the player needs to achieve at least 100 points to enter the qualifying stage.</p>
<p>Write a script that will check to see if the player has achieved at least 100 points in his class. If so, he enters the qualifying stage. </p>
<p>In that case, we return, <code>&quot;Well done! You have advanced to the qualifying stage. Win 2 out of your next 3 games to rank up.&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise return, <code>False/false</code> (according to the language n use).</p>
<h2>NOTE</h2>:  Remember, in <b>C#</b> you have to cast your output value to <b>Object</b> type!
