### Problem:
<p>At a job interview, you are challenged to write an algorithm to check if a given string, <code>s</code>, can be formed from two other strings, <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code>.</p>
<p>The restriction is that the characters in <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code> should be in the same order as in <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>The interviewer gives you the following example and tells you to figure out the rest from the given test cases.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&apos;codewars&apos; is a merge from &apos;cdw&apos; and &apos;oears&apos;:

    s:  c o d e w a r s   = codewars
part1:  c   d   w         = cdw
part2:    o   e   a r s   = oears</code></pre>
