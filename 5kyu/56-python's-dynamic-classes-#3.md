### Problem:
<p><em>So</em> - shouted boss, heading to Tim&apos;s office - <em>we have new contract!</em>.
<br><em>- What is it?</em> - ask Tim.
<br><em>- Do not know, frankly, it&apos;s secret! It&apos;s from <strong>army</strong>!</em> - boss was obviously excited.
<br><em>- So how are we supposed to write anything, if it is so big secret?</em>
<br><em>- And that&apos;s the point! We won&apos;t know it, but we will write it. We have to prepare mechanism to create <strong>dynamic classes with properties and methods</strong> given as a parameters.</em> - explained boss.
<br><em>- I don&apos;t think that&apos;s, umm... But would we at least know names of these properties and methods, right?</em>
<br><em>- No. Remember that it&apos;s secret, so we&apos;ll not know anything!</em>
<br><em>- Nah, it&apos;s impossible!</em> - cried Tim.</p>
<p>Then Tims went to find you - his almighty guru - and ask to help him. You reminded him: -<em> It&apos;s Python, here everything is possible! Ok, let&apos;s see...</em>.</p>
<p>So, in that Kata, your task is to finish function <code>create_class</code> that will get some class name and <em>secret</em> dictionary and make class of it. That dictionary will be delivered by function <code>army_get_secret_from_file()</code> which is already completed. 
Tim also asked you to make sure that if class name is empty, it should be None as result, and to make possible to call function without second parameter. Returned object should be the new-style class, which has only to inherit the base methods of the class <code>object</code>.</p>
<p>Do not worry, these test properties and methods are dummy, so you won&apos;t know the army&apos;s mysteries, so you (probably) won&apos;t be executed. </p>
