### Problem:
<h1 id="story">Story</h1>
<p>You were supposed to implement a node-based calculator. Hopefully for you, a colleague agreed to do the task. When the management saw the code, they were infuriated with its low quality, and as a punishment told you to shorten it as much as possible...</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="task">Task</h1>
<p>You will be given a ready solution passing all the fixed and random tests. Unfortunately for you, it is very long and overly repetitive. Current code length is <code>901</code> characters. Your task is to shorten it to at most <code>300</code> characters.</p>
<p><strong>Note/hint</strong>: you can modify the implementation any way you want, as long as it is written using only OOP; the sample tests check solution&apos;s functionality the same way as the final tests do - if your solution passes the former, it will also pass the latter.</p>
