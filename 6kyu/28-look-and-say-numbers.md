### Problem:
<p>There exists a sequence of numbers that follows the pattern</p>
<pre><code>          1
         11
         21
        1211
       111221
       312211
      13112221
     1113213211
          .
          .
          .</code></pre><p>Starting with &quot;1&quot; the following lines are produced by &quot;saying what you see&quot;, so that line two is &quot;one one&quot;, line three is &quot;two one(s)&quot;, line four is &quot;one two one one&quot;.</p>
<p>Write a function that given a starting value as a string, returns the appropriate sequence as a list. The starting value can have any number of digits. The termination condition is a defined by the maximum number of iterations, also supplied as an argument.</p>
