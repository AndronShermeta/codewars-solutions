### Problem:
<p>You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid.  You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk.  The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. [&apos;n&apos;, &apos;s&apos;, &apos;w&apos;, &apos;e&apos;]).  You always walk only a single block in a direction and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return <strong>true</strong> if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don&apos;t want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point.  Return <strong>false</strong> otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters (&apos;n&apos;, &apos;s&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, or &apos;w&apos; only).  It will never give you an empty array (that&apos;s not a walk, that&apos;s standing still!).</p>
