### Problem:
<p>Given a side length <code>n</code>, traveling only right and down how many ways are there to get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of an <code>n by n</code> grid?</p>
<p>Your mission is to write a program to do just that!</p>
<p>Add code to <code>route(n)</code> that returns the number of routes for a grid <code>n by n</code> (if n is less than 1 return 0).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>-100 -&gt; 0

1 -&gt; 2

2 -&gt; 6

20 -&gt; 137846528820</code></pre><p>Note: 
you&apos;re traveling on the edges of the squares in the grid not the squares themselves.</p>
<p>PS.If anyone has any suggestions of how to improve this kata please let me know.</p>
