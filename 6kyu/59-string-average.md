### Problem:
<p>You are given a string of numbers between 0-9. Find the average of these numbers and return it as a floored whole number (ie: no decimal places) written out as a string. Eg:</p>
<p>&quot;zero nine five two&quot; -&gt; &quot;four&quot;</p>
<p>If the string is empty or includes a number greater than 9, return &quot;n/a&quot;</p>
