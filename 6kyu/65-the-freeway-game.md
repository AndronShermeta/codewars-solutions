### Problem:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Sydney_-_Newcastle_freeway_north_bound_at_Berowra.jpg/500px-Sydney_-_Newcastle_freeway_north_bound_at_Berowra.jpg">


<h1 id="back-story">Back-Story</h1>
<p>Every day I travel on the freeway.</p>
<p>When I am more bored than usual I sometimes like to play the following counting game I made up:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I join the freeway my count is <code>0</code></li>
<li>Add <code>1</code> for every car that I overtake</li>
<li>Subtract <code>1</code> for every car that overtakes me</li>
<li>Stop counting when I reach my exit</li>
</ul>
<p>What an easy game! What fun!</p>
<h1 id="kata-task">Kata Task</h1>
<p>You will be given</p>
<ul>
<li>The distance to my exit (km)</li>
<li>How fast I am going (kph)</li>
<li>Information about a lot of other cars <ul>
<li>Their time (relative to me) as I join the freeway. For example,<ul>
<li><code>-1.5</code> means they already passed my starting point <code>1.5</code> minutes ago</li>
<li><code>2.2</code> means they will pass my starting point <code>2.2</code> minutes from now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How fast they are going (kph)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Find what is my &quot;score&quot; as I exit the freeway!</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Assume all cars travel at a constant speeds</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:25px;font-weight:bold;color:red;background:yellow;border:solid orange 5px;">&#xA0;Safety Warning&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>If you plan to play this &quot;game&quot; remember that it is not really a game. You are in a <strong>real</strong> car.</p>
<p>There may be a temptation to try to beat your previous best score.</p>
<p>Please don&apos;t do that...</p>
