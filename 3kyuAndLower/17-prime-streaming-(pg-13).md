### Problem:
<p>Create an endless stream of prime numbers - a bit like <code>IntStream.of(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17)</code>, but infinite. The stream must be able to produce a million primes in a few seconds.</p>
<p>If this is too easy, try <a href="/kata/prime-streaming-nc-17/" target="_blank">Prime Streaming (NC-17)</a>.</p>
